This project is a full-stack CRUD Todo application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, while persisting data to a backend server. The frontend is built with React and styled using Chakra UI, while the backend API is built with NestJS and connects to a PostgreSQL database via Prisma ORM. The app demonstrates clean separation of frontend and backend responsibilities, full CRUD functionality, and RESTful API consumption. The main goal was to practice REST API development with NestJS and Prisma, and to integrate it with a dynamic React UI for task management.
